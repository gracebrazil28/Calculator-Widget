## Project #6: Calculator Widget Using Python

### Welcome to my gihthub repository!
This quick widget project was to test out what I've learnt from learning python online. [More information about the widget here](https://preciousgracebrazil.wordpress.com/project-type/simple-calculator-widget/) in my online portfolio.

Hopefully, I'll be creating more hardware project next time. Happy Making everyone!
